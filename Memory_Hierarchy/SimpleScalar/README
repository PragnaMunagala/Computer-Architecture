#In this program, memory is accessed by reading and writing the data in different patterns(linear and random) and
 the average access time of L1, L2, L3 cache and main memory is measured using SimpleScalar simulator.

#The access time, hit rates is measured by using an element of cache line size of 64bytes. The array size of the elements is
 varied and the average access time is calculated for both read and write in linear and random patters. The results
 are tabulated and plotted and are mentioned in the Report.

#For sequential pattern, a structure with data array of 64bytes is created and is used to perform read and write operations.

#For random pattern, a structure of cache line size of 64bytes is created having pointer to other element of same type, data array,
 flags as the attributes.

#For random accessing the memory, pointer chasing technique is implemented.

#Accessing memory for read and write operation on array of different sizes is done for multiple iterations(1000 in my program) to
measure in high precision.

#In reading operation in both sequential and random pattern, only first data element of each block of each array is only read as
 reading the entire block will not have much impact on the average time due to the concept of spatial locality.

#The bash script files are written to easily run each of the files seqread.c, seqwrite.c, ranread.c, ranwrite.c on the simulator to measure the 
 clock cycles, hit rates of read/write in sequential/random patterns.

#The output of the program prints the write and read average access time in nanoseconds, hit rate of various caches for both sequential
 and random patterns.

Steps to execute
###############################

#Open the terminal and run the following command
	sudo -s

#Enter the root password

#Create cse420 folder in the Home directoy and setup the simplescalar simlulator as mentioned in the simplescalar_instruction.pdf

#Extract the Task2 files (seqread.c, seqwrite.c, ranread.c, ranwrite.c, run.sh, out.sh) into cse420 folder

#In the terminal traverse to the cse420 directory having the files downloaded and run the following command to run the code on simulator
	make
	bash run.sh

#Run the following command to display the average access time, hit rate of different level caches of various array sizes in read and write operations
	bash out.sh
