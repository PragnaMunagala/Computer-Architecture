#In this program, memory is accessed by reading and writing the data in different patterns(linear and random) and
 the average access time of L1, L2, L3 cache and main memory is measured.

#The access time is measured by using an element of cache line size of 64bytes. The array size of the elements is
 varied and the average access time is calculated for both read and write in linear and random patters. The results
 are tabulated and plotted and are mentioned in the Report.

#For sequential pattern, a structure with data array of 64bytes is created and is used to perform read and write operations.

#For random pattern, a structure of cache line size of 64bytes is created having pointer to other element of same type, data array,
 flags as the attributes.

#For random accessing the memory, pointer chasing technique is implemented.

#clock() is used to calculate the CPU clock cycles for the execution of memory operations.

#Accessing memory for read and write operation on array of different sizes is done for multiple iterations(50000 in my program) to
measure in high precision.

#In reading operation in both sequential and random pattern, only first data element of each block of each array is only read as
 reading the entire block will not have much impact on the average time due to the concept of spatial locality.

#The output of the program prints the write and read average access time in nanoseconds for both sequential and random patterns.
